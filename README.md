# practice

Things I learned with this project:

Had issues with the onclick not working. Had to remove the type="module" from the script tag. onclick does not work in module.

The if statement on the toggleSwitch wouldn't accept !toggle.checked to add/remove the class but would accept toggle.checked.

If updating text for multiple spans using queryselectorall you have to loop over each element use of the span.
